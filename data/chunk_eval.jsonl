What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.\n\nMaybe it wants to play bingo?\n\nBingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers. Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is marked on all boards on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in any row or any column of a board are marked, that board wins. (Diagonals don't count.)\n\nThe submarine has a bingo subsystem to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass the time. It automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input). For example:\n\n7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1\n\n22 13 17 11  0\n 8  2 23  4 24\n21  9 14 16  7\n 6 10  3 18  5\n 1 12 20 15 19\n\n 3 15  0  2 22\n 9 18 13 17  5\n19  8  7 25 23\n20 11 10 24  4\n14 21 16 12  6\n\n14 21 17 24  4\n10 16 15  9 19\n18  8 23 26 20\n22 11 13  6  5\n 2  0 12  3  7\nAfter the first five numbers are drawn (7, 4, 9, 5, and 11), there are no winners, but the boards are marked as follows (shown here adjacent to each other to save space):\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\nAfter the next six numbers are drawn (17, 23, 2, 0, 14, and 21), there are still no winners:\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\nFinally, 24 is drawn:\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\nAt this point, the third board wins because it has at least one complete row or column of marked numbers (in this case, the entire top row is marked: 14 21 17 24 4).\n\nThe score of the winning board can now be calculated. Start by finding the sum of all unmarked numbers on that board; in this case, the sum is 188. Then, multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won, 24, to get the final score, 188 * 24 = 4512.\n\nTo guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win first. What will your final score be if you choose that board?\n\nPlease write the solution in python. Save the solution in a file named solution.py.

As you get close, you find an experimental coprocessor doing so much work that the local programs are afraid it will halt and catch fire. This would cause serious issues for the rest of the computer, so you head in and see what you can do.\n\nThe code it's running seems to be a variant of the kind you saw recently on that tablet. The general functionality seems very similar, but some of the instructions are different:\n\nset X Y sets register X to the value of Y.\nsub X Y decreases register X by the value of Y.\nmul X Y sets register X to the result of multiplying the value contained in register X by the value of Y.\njnz X Y jumps with an offset of the value of Y, but only if the value of X is not zero. (An offset of 2 skips the next instruction, an offset of -1 jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)\nOnly the instructions listed above are used. The eight registers here, named a through h, all start at 0.\n\nThe coprocessor is currently set to some kind of debug mode, which allows for testing, but prevents it from doing any meaningful work.\n\nIf you run the program (your puzzle input), how many times is the mul instruction invoked?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 3025.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow, it's time to fix the problem.\n\nThe debug mode switch is wired directly to register a. You flip the switch, which makes register a now start at 1 when the program is executed.\n\nImmediately, the coprocessor begins to overheat. Whoever wrote this program obviously didn't choose a very efficient implementation. You'll need to optimize the program if it has any hope of completing before Santa needs that printer working.\n\nThe coprocessor's ultimate goal is to determine the final value left in register h once the program completes. Technically, if it had that... it wouldn't even need to run the program.\n\nAfter setting register a to 1, if the program were to run to completion, what value would be left in register h?\n\nPlease write the solution in python.

Without the ability to perform basic arithmetic and logic functions, the submarine can't produce cool patterns with its Christmas lights!\n\nIt also can't navigate. Or run the oxygen system.\n\nDon't worry, though - you probably have enough oxygen left to give you enough time to build a new ALU.\n\nThe ALU is a four-dimensional processing unit: it has integer variables w, x, y, and z. These variables all start with the value 0. The ALU also supports six instructions:\n\ninp a - Read an input value and write it to variable a.\nadd a b - Add the value of a to the value of b, then store the result in variable a.\nmul a b - Multiply the value of a by the value of b, then store the result in variable a.\ndiv a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b, truncate the result to an integer, then store the result in variable a. (Here, \"truncate\" means to round the value toward zero.)\nmod a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b, then store the remainder in variable a. (This is also called the modulo operation.)\neql a b - If the value of a and b are equal, then store the value 1 in variable a. Otherwise, store the value 0 in variable a.\nIn all of these instructions, a and b are placeholders; a will always be the variable where the result of the operation is stored (one of w, x, y, or z), while b can be either a variable or a number. Numbers can be positive or negative, but will always be integers.\n\nThe ALU has no jump instructions; in an ALU program, every instruction is run exactly once in order from top to bottom. The program halts after the last instruction has finished executing.\n\n(Program authors should be especially cautious; attempting to execute div with b=0 or attempting to execute mod with a<0 or b<=0 will cause the program to crash and might even damage the ALU. These operations are never intended in any serious ALU program.)\n\nFor example, here is an ALU program which takes an input number, negates it, and stores it in x:\n\ninp x\nmul x -1\nHere is an ALU program which takes two input numbers, then sets z to 1 if the second input number is three times larger than the first input number, or sets z to 0 otherwise:\n\ninp z\ninp x\nmul z 3\neql z x\nHere is an ALU program which takes a non-negative integer as input, converts it into binary, and stores the lowest (1's) bit in z, the second-lowest (2's) bit in y, the third-lowest (4's) bit in x, and the fourth-lowest (8's) bit in w:\n\ninp w\nadd z w\nmod z 2\ndiv w 2\nadd y w\nmod y 2\ndiv w 2\nadd x w\nmod x 2\ndiv w 2\nmod w 2\nOnce you have built a replacement ALU, you can install it in the submarine, which will immediately resume what it was doing when the ALU failed: validating the submarine's model number. To do this, the ALU will run the MOdel Number Automatic Detector program (MONAD, your puzzle input).\n\nSubmarine model numbers are always fourteen-digit numbers consisting only of digits 1 through 9. The digit 0 cannot appear in a model number.\n\nWhen MONAD checks a hypothetical fourteen-digit model number, it uses fourteen separate inp instructions, each expecting a single digit of the model number in order of most to least significant. (So, to check the model number 13579246899999, you would give 1 to the first inp instruction, 3 to the second inp instruction, 5 to the third inp instruction, and so on.) This means that when operating MONAD, each input instruction should only ever be given an integer value of at least 1 and at most 9.\n\nThen, after MONAD has finished running all of its instructions, it will indicate that the model number was valid by leaving a 0 in variable z. However, if the model number was invalid, it will leave some other non-zero value in z.\n\nMONAD imposes additional, mysterious restrictions on model numbers, and legend says the last copy of the MONAD documentation was eaten by a tanuki. You'll need to figure out what MONAD does some other way.\n\nTo enable as many submarine features as possible, find the largest valid fourteen-digit model number that contains no 0 digits. What is the largest model number accepted by MONAD?\n\nPlease write the solution in python. Save the solution in a file named solution.py.

To help keep you sane, the Elves have sent you a care package.\n\nIt's a new game for the ship's arcade cabinet! Unfortunately, the arcade is all the way on the other end of the ship. Surely, it won't be hard to build your own - the care package even comes with schematics.\n\nThe arcade cabinet runs Intcode software like the game the Elves sent (your puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square tiles on a grid. The software draws tiles to the screen with output instructions: every three output instructions specify the x position (distance from the left), y position (distance from the top), and tile id. The tile id is interpreted as follows:\n\n0 is an empty tile. No game object appears in this tile.\n1 is a wall tile. Walls are indestructible barriers.\n2 is a block tile. Blocks can be broken by the ball.\n3 is a horizontal paddle tile. The paddle is indestructible.\n4 is a ball tile. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.\nFor example, a sequence of output values like 1,2,3,6,5,4 would draw a horizontal paddle tile (1 tile from the left and 2 tiles from the top) and a ball tile (6 tiles from the left and 5 tiles from the top).\n\nStart the game. How many block tiles are on the screen when the game exits?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 247.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe game didn't run because you didn't put in any quarters. Unfortunately, you did not bring any quarters. Memory address 0 represents the number of quarters that have been inserted; set it to 2 to play for free.\n\nThe arcade cabinet has a joystick that can move left and right. The software reads the position of the joystick with input instructions:\n\nIf the joystick is in the neutral position, provide 0.\nIf the joystick is tilted to the left, provide -1.\nIf the joystick is tilted to the right, provide 1.\nThe arcade cabinet also has a segment display capable of showing a single number that represents the player's current score. When three output instructions specify X=-1, Y=0, the third output instruction is not a tile; the value instead specifies the new score to show in the segment display. For example, a sequence of output values like -1,0,12345 would show 12345 as the player's current score.\n\nBeat the game by breaking all the blocks. What is your score after the last block is broken?\n\nPlease write the solution in python. Save the solution in a file named solution.py.

This island is surprisingly cold and there definitely aren't any thermals to glide on, so you leave your hang glider behind.\n\nYou wander around for a while, but you don't find any people or animals. However, you do occasionally find signposts labeled \"Hot Springs\" pointing in a seemingly consistent direction; maybe you can find someone at the hot springs and ask them where the desert-machine parts are made.\n\nThe landscape here is alien; even the flowers and trees are made of metal. As you stop to admire some metal grass, you notice something metallic scurry away in your peripheral vision and jump into a big pipe! It didn't look like any animal you've ever seen; if you want a better look, you'll need to get ahead of it.\n\nScanning the area, you discover that the entire field you're standing on is densely packed with pipes; it was hard to tell at first because they're the same metallic silver color as the \"ground\". You make a quick sketch of all of the surface pipes you can see (your puzzle input).\n\nThe pipes are arranged in a two-dimensional grid of tiles:\n\n| is a vertical pipe connecting north and south.\n- is a horizontal pipe connecting east and west.\nL is a 90-degree bend connecting north and east.\nJ is a 90-degree bend connecting north and west.\n7 is a 90-degree bend connecting south and west.\nF is a 90-degree bend connecting south and east.\n. is ground; there is no pipe in this tile.\nS is the starting position of the animal; there is a pipe on this tile, but your sketch doesn't show what shape the pipe has.\nBased on the acoustics of the animal's scurrying, you're confident the pipe that contains the animal is one large, continuous loop.\n\nFor example, here is a square loop of pipe:\n\n.....\n.F-7.\n.|.|.\n.L-J.\n.....\nIf the animal had entered this loop in the northwest corner, the sketch would instead look like this:\n\n.....\n.S-7.\n.|.|.\n.L-J.\n.....\nIn the above diagram, the S tile is still a 90-degree F bend: you can tell because of how the adjacent pipes connect to it.\n\nUnfortunately, there are also many pipes that aren't connected to the loop! This sketch shows the same loop as above:\n\n-L|F7\n7S-7|\nL|7||\n-L-J|\nL|-JF\nIn the above diagram, you can still figure out which pipes form the main loop: they're the ones connected to S, pipes those pipes connect to, pipes those pipes connect to, and so on. Every pipe in the main loop connects to its two neighbors (including S, which will have exactly two pipes connecting to it, and which is assumed to connect back to those two pipes).\n\nHere is a sketch that contains a slightly more complex main loop:\n\n..F7.\n.FJ|.\nSJ.L7\n|F--J\nLJ...\nHere's the same example sketch with the extra, non-main-loop pipe tiles also shown:\n\n7-F7-\n.FJ|7\nSJLL7\n|F--J\nLJ.LJ\nIf you want to get out ahead of the animal, you should find the tile in the loop that is farthest from the starting position. Because the animal is in the pipe, it doesn't make sense to measure this by direct distance. Instead, you need to find the tile that would take the longest number of steps along the loop to reach from the starting point - regardless of which way around the loop the animal went.\n\nIn the first example with the square loop:\n\n.....\n.S-7.\n.|.|.\n.L-J.\n.....\nYou can count the distance each tile in the loop is from the starting point like this:\n\n.....\n.012.\n.1.3.\n.234.\n.....\nIn this example, the farthest point from the start is 4 steps away.\n\nHere's the more complex loop again:\n\n..F7.\n.FJ|.\nSJ.L7\n|F--J\nLJ...\nHere are the distances for each tile on that loop:\n\n..45.\n.236.\n01.78\n14567\n23...\nFind the single giant loop starting at S. How many steps along the loop does it take to get from the starting position to the point farthest from the starting position?\n\nPlease write the solution in python.

Clean water starts flowing over the edge of Island Island.\n\nThey offer to help you go over the edge of Island Island, too! Just hold on tight to one end of this impossibly long rope and they'll lower you down a safe distance from the massive waterfall you just created.\n\nAs you finally reach Snow Island, you see that the water isn't really reaching the ground: it's being absorbed by the air itself. It looks like you'll finally have a little downtime while the moisture builds up to snow-producing levels. Snow Island is pretty scenic, even without any snow; why not take a walk?\n\nThere's a map of nearby hiking trails (your puzzle input) that indicates paths (.), forest (#), and steep slopes (^, >, v, and <).\n\nFor example:\n\n#.#####################\n#.......#########...###\n#######.#########.#.###\n###.....#.>.>.###.#.###\n###v#####.#v#.###.#.###\n###.>...#.#.#.....#...#\n###v###.#.#.#########.#\n###...#.#.#.......#...#\n#####.#.#.#######.#.###\n#.....#.#.#.......#...#\n#.#####.#.#.#########v#\n#.#...#...#...###...>.#\n#.#.#v#######v###.###v#\n#...#.>.#...>.>.#.###.#\n#####v#.#.###v#.#.###.#\n#.....#...#...#.#.#...#\n#.#########.###.#.#.###\n#...###...#...#...#.###\n###.###.#.###v#####v###\n#...#...#.#.>.>.#.>.###\n#.###.###.#.###.#.#v###\n#.....###...###...#...#\n#####################.#\nYou're currently on the single path tile in the top row; your goal is to reach the single path tile in the bottom row. Because of all the mist from the waterfall, the slopes are probably quite icy; if you step onto a slope tile, your next step must be downhill (in the direction the arrow is pointing). To make sure you have the most scenic hike possible, never step onto the same tile twice. What is the longest hike you can take?\n\nIn the example above, the longest hike you can take is marked with O, and your starting position is marked S:\n\n#S#####################\n#OOOOOOO#########...###\n#######O#########.#.###\n###OOOOO#OOO>.###.#.###\n###O#####O#O#.###.#.###\n###OOOOO#O#O#.....#...#\n###v###O#O#O#########.#\n###...#O#O#OOOOOOO#...#\n#####.#O#O#######O#.###\n#.....#O#O#OOOOOOO#...#\n#.#####O#O#O#########v#\n#.#...#OOO#OOO###OOOOO#\n#.#.#v#######O###O###O#\n#...#.>.#...>OOO#O###O#\n#####v#.#.###v#O#O###O#\n#.....#...#...#O#O#OOO#\n#.#########.###O#O#O###\n#...###...#...#OOO#O###\n###.###.#.###v#####O###\n#...#...#.#.>.>.#.>O###\n#.###.###.#.###.#.#O###\n#.....###...###...#OOO#\n#####################O#\nThis hike contains 94 steps. (The other possible hikes you could have taken were 90, 86, 82, 82, and 74 steps long.)\n\nFind the longest hike you can take through the hiking trails listed on your map. How many steps long is the longest hike?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 2110.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nAs you reach the trailhead, you realize that the ground isn't as slippery as you expected; you'll have no problem climbing up the steep slopes.\n\nNow, treat all slopes as if they were normal paths (.). You still want to make sure you have the most scenic hike possible, so continue to ensure that you never step onto the same tile twice. What is the longest hike you can take?\n\nIn the example above, this increases the longest hike to 154 steps:\n\n#S#####################\n#OOOOOOO#########OOO###\n#######O#########O#O###\n###OOOOO#.>OOO###O#O###\n###O#####.#O#O###O#O###\n###O>...#.#O#OOOOO#OOO#\n###O###.#.#O#########O#\n###OOO#.#.#OOOOOOO#OOO#\n#####O#.#.#######O#O###\n#OOOOO#.#.#OOOOOOO#OOO#\n#O#####.#.#O#########O#\n#O#OOO#...#OOO###...>O#\n#O#O#O#######O###.###O#\n#OOO#O>.#...>O>.#.###O#\n#####O#.#.###O#.#.###O#\n#OOOOO#...#OOO#.#.#OOO#\n#O#########O###.#.#O###\n#OOO###OOO#OOO#...#O###\n###O###O#O###O#####O###\n#OOO#OOO#O#OOO>.#.>O###\n#O###O###O#O###.#.#O###\n#OOOOO###OOO###...#OOO#\n#####################O#\nFind the longest hike you can take through the surprisingly dry hiking trails listed on your map. How many steps long is the longest hike?\n\nPlease write the solution in python. Save the solution in a file named solution.py.

As you walk to your high-speed train, the Elves at the Mythical Information Bureau contact you again. They think their satellite has collected an image of a sea monster! Unfortunately, the connection to the satellite is having problems, and many of the messages sent back from the satellite have been corrupted.\n\nThey sent you a list of the rules valid messages should obey and a list of received messages they've collected so far (your puzzle input).\n\nThe rules for valid messages (the top part of your puzzle input) are numbered and build upon each other. For example:\n\n0: 1 2\n1: \"a\"\n2: 1 3 | 3 1\n3: \"b\"\nSome rules, like 3: \"b\", simply match a single character (in this case, b).\n\nThe remaining rules list the sub-rules that must be followed; for example, the rule 0: 1 2 means that to match rule 0, the text being checked must match rule 1, and the text after the part that matched rule 1 must then match rule 2.\n\nSome of the rules have multiple lists of sub-rules separated by a pipe (|). This means that at least one list of sub-rules must match. (The ones that match might be different each time the rule is encountered.) For example, the rule 2: 1 3 | 3 1 means that to match rule 2, the text being checked must match rule 1 followed by rule 3 or it must match rule 3 followed by rule 1.\n\nFortunately, there are no loops in the rules, so the list of possible matches will be finite. Since rule 1 matches a and rule 3 matches b, rule 2 matches either ab or ba. Therefore, rule 0 matches aab or aba.\n\nHere's a more interesting example:\n\n0: 4 1 5\n1: 2 3 | 3 2\n2: 4 4 | 5 5\n3: 4 5 | 5 4\n4: \"a\"\n5: \"b\"\nHere, because rule 4 matches a and rule 5 matches b, rule 2 matches two letters that are the same (aa or bb), and rule 3 matches two letters that are different (ab or ba).\n\nSince rule 1 matches rules 2 and 3 once each in either order, it must match two pairs of letters, one pair with matching letters and one pair with different letters. This leaves eight possibilities: aaab, aaba, bbab, bbba, abaa, abbb, baaa, or babb.\n\nRule 0, therefore, matches a (rule 4), then any of the eight options from rule 1, then b (rule 5): aaaabb, aaabab, abbabb, abbbab, aabaab, aabbbb, abaaab, or ababbb.\n\nThe received messages (the bottom part of your puzzle input) need to be checked against the rules so you can determine which are valid and which are corrupted. Including the rules and the messages together, this might look like:\n\n0: 4 1 5\n1: 2 3 | 3 2\n2: 4 4 | 5 5\n3: 4 5 | 5 4\n4: \"a\"\n5: \"b\"\n\nababbb\nbababa\nabbbab\naaabbb\naaaabbb\nYour goal is to determine the number of messages that completely match rule 0. In the above example, ababbb and abbbab match, but bababa, aaabbb, and aaaabbb do not, producing the answer 2. The whole message must match all of rule 0; there can't be extra unmatched characters in the message. (For example, aaaabbb might appear to match rule 0 above, but it has an extra unmatched b on the end.)\n\nHow many messages completely match rule 0?\n\nPlease write the solution in python.

In order to make use of the sand to filter water, some of the bricks will need to be broken apart - nay, disintegrated - back into freely flowing sand.\n\nThe stack is tall enough that you'll have to be careful about choosing which bricks to disintegrate; if you disintegrate the wrong brick, large portions of the stack could topple, which sounds pretty dangerous.\n\nThe Elves responsible for water filtering operations took a snapshot of the bricks while they were still falling (your puzzle input) which should let you work out which bricks are safe to disintegrate. For example:\n\n1,0,1~1,2,1\n0,0,2~2,0,2\n0,2,3~2,2,3\n0,0,4~0,2,4\n2,0,5~2,2,5\n0,1,6~2,1,6\n1,1,8~1,1,9\nEach line of text in the snapshot represents the position of a single brick at the time the snapshot was taken. The position is given as two x,y,z coordinates - one for each end of the brick - separated by a tilde (~). Each brick is made up of a single straight line of cubes, and the Elves were even careful to choose a time for the snapshot that had all of the free-falling bricks at integer positions above the ground, so the whole snapshot is aligned to a three-dimensional cube grid.\n\nA line like 2,2,2~2,2,2 means that both ends of the brick are at the same coordinate - in other words, that the brick is a single cube.\n\nLines like 0,0,10~1,0,10 or 0,0,10~0,1,10 both represent bricks that are two cubes in volume, both oriented horizontally. The first brick extends in the x direction, while the second brick extends in the y direction.\n\nA line like 0,0,1~0,0,10 represents a ten-cube brick which is oriented vertically. One end of the brick is the cube located at 0,0,1, while the other end of the brick is located directly above it at 0,0,10.\n\nThe ground is at z=0 and is perfectly flat; the lowest z value a brick can have is therefore 1. So, 5,5,1~5,6,1 and 0,2,1~0,2,5 are both resting on the ground, but 3,3,2~3,3,3 was above the ground at the time of the snapshot.\n\nBecause the snapshot was taken while the bricks were still falling, some bricks will still be in the air; you'll need to start by figuring out where they will end up. Bricks are magically stabilized, so they never rotate, even in weird situations like where a long horizontal brick is only supported on one end. Two bricks cannot occupy the same position, so a falling brick will come to rest upon the first other brick it encounters.\n\nHere is the same example again, this time with each brick given a letter so it can be marked in diagrams:\n\n1,0,1~1,2,1   <- A\n0,0,2~2,0,2   <- B\n0,2,3~2,2,3   <- C\n0,0,4~0,2,4   <- D\n2,0,5~2,2,5   <- E\n0,1,6~2,1,6   <- F\n1,1,8~1,1,9   <- G\nAt the time of the snapshot, from the side so the x axis goes left to right, these bricks are arranged like this:\n\n x\n012\n.G. 9\n.G. 8\n... 7\nFFF 6\n..E 5 z\nD.. 4\nCCC 3\nBBB 2\n.A. 1\n--- 0\nRotating the perspective 90 degrees so the y axis now goes left to right, the same bricks are arranged like this:\n\n y\n012\n.G. 9\n.G. 8\n... 7\n.F. 6\nEEE 5 z\nDDD 4\n..C 3\nB.. 2\nAAA 1\n--- 0\nOnce all of the bricks fall downward as far as they can go, the stack looks like this, where ? means bricks are hidden behind other bricks at that location:\n\n x\n012\n.G. 6\n.G. 5\nFFF 4\nD.E 3 z\n??? 2\n.A. 1\n--- 0\nAgain from the side:\n\n y\n012\n.G. 6\n.G. 5\n.F. 4\n??? 3 z\nB.C 2\nAAA 1\n--- 0\nNow that all of the bricks have settled, it becomes easier to tell which bricks are supporting which other bricks:\n\nBrick A is the only brick supporting bricks B and C.\nBrick B is one of two bricks supporting brick D and brick E.\nBrick C is the other brick supporting brick D and brick E.\nBrick D supports brick F.\nBrick E also supports brick F.\nBrick F supports brick G.\nBrick G isn't supporting any bricks.\nYour first task is to figure out which bricks are safe to disintegrate. A brick can be safely disintegrated if, after removing it, no other bricks would fall further directly downward. Don't actually disintegrate any bricks - just determine what would happen if, for each brick, only that brick were disintegrated. Bricks can be disintegrated even if they're completely surrounded by other bricks; you can squeeze between bricks if you need to.\n\nIn this example, the bricks can be disintegrated as follows:\n\nBrick A cannot be disintegrated safely; if it were disintegrated, bricks B and C would both fall.\nBrick B can be disintegrated; the bricks above it (D and E) would still be supported by brick C.\nBrick C can be disintegrated; the bricks above it (D and E) would still be supported by brick B.\nBrick D can be disintegrated; the brick above it (F) would still be supported by brick E.\nBrick E can be disintegrated; the brick above it (F) would still be supported by brick D.\nBrick F cannot be disintegrated; the brick above it (G) would fall.\nBrick G can be disintegrated; it does not support any other bricks.\nSo, in this example, 5 bricks can be safely disintegrated.\n\nFigure how the blocks will settle based on the snapshot. Once they've settled, consider disintegrating a single brick; how many bricks could be safely chosen as the one to get disintegrated?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 519.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nDisintegrating bricks one at a time isn't going to be fast enough. While it might sound dangerous, what you really need is a chain reaction.\n\nYou'll need to figure out the best brick to disintegrate. For each brick, determine how many other bricks would fall if that brick were disintegrated.\n\nUsing the same example as above:\n\nDisintegrating brick A would cause all 6 other bricks to fall.\nDisintegrating brick F would cause only 1 other brick, G, to fall.\nDisintegrating any other brick would cause no other bricks to fall. So, in this example, the sum of the number of other bricks that would fall as a result of disintegrating each brick is 7.\n\nFor each brick, determine how many other bricks would fall if that brick were disintegrated. What is the sum of the number of other bricks that would fall?\n\nPlease write the solution in python. Save the solution in a file named solution.py.

Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.\n\nEach wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.\n\nThe included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: x AND y -> z means to connect wires x and y to an AND gate, and then connect its output to wire z.\n\nFor example:\n\n123 -> x means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.\nx AND y -> z means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is provided to wire z.\np LSHIFT 2 -> q means that the value from wire p is left-shifted by 2 and then provided to wire q.\nNOT e -> f means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire e is provided to wire f.\nOther possible gates include OR (bitwise OR) and RSHIFT (right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.\n\nFor example, here is a simple circuit:\n\n123 -> x\n456 -> y\nx AND y -> d\nx OR y -> e\nx LSHIFT 2 -> f\ny RSHIFT 2 -> g\nNOT x -> h\nNOT y -> i\nAfter it is run, these are the signals on the wires:\n\nd: 72\ne: 507\nf: 492\ng: 114\nh: 65412\ni: 65079\nx: 123\ny: 456\nIn little Bobby's kit's instructions booklet (provided as your puzzle input), what signal is ultimately provided to wire a?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 16076.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow, take the signal you got on wire a, override wire b to that signal, and reset the other wires (including wire a). What new signal is ultimately provided to wire a?\n\nPlease write the solution in python. Save the solution in a file named solution.py.

They'd like some help debugging a malfunctioning experimental energy source aboard one of their super-secret imaging satellites.\n\nThe experimental energy source is based on cutting-edge technology: a set of Conway Cubes contained in a pocket dimension! When you hear it's having problems, you can't help but agree to take a look.\n\nThe pocket dimension contains an infinite 3-dimensional grid. At every integer 3-dimensional coordinate (x,y,z), there exists a single cube which is either active or inactive.\n\nIn the initial state of the pocket dimension, almost all cubes start inactive. The only exception to this is a small flat region of cubes (your puzzle input); the cubes in this region start in the specified active (#) or inactive (.) state.\n\nThe energy source then proceeds to boot up by executing six cycles.\n\nEach cube only ever considers its neighbors: any of the 26 other cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most 1. For example, given the cube at x=1,y=2,z=3, its neighbors include the cube at x=2,y=2,z=2, the cube at x=0,y=2,z=3, and so on.\n\nDuring a cycle, all cubes simultaneously change their state according to the following rules:\n\nIf a cube is active and exactly 2 or 3 of its neighbors are also active, the cube remains active. Otherwise, the cube becomes inactive.\nIf a cube is inactive but exactly 3 of its neighbors are active, the cube becomes active. Otherwise, the cube remains inactive.\nThe engineers responsible for this experimental energy source would like you to simulate the pocket dimension and determine what the configuration of cubes should be at the end of the six-cycle boot process.\n\nFor example, consider the following initial state:\n\n.#.\n..#\n###\nEven though the pocket dimension is 3-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1 region of the 3-dimensional space.)\n\nSimulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each given z coordinate (and the frame of view follows the active cells in each cycle):\n\nBefore any cycles:\n\nz=0\n.#.\n..#\n###\n\n\nAfter 1 cycle:\n\nz=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0\n#.#\n.##\n.#.\n\nz=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\n\nAfter 2 cycles:\n\nz=-2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1\n..#..\n.#..#\n....#\n.#...\n.....\n\nz=0\n##...\n##...\n#....\n....#\n.###.\n\nz=1\n..#..\n.#..#\n....#\n.#...\n.....\n\nz=2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\n\nAfter 3 cycles:\n\nz=-2\n.......\n.......\n..##...\n..###..\n.......\n.......\n.......\n\nz=-1\n..#....\n...#...\n#......\n.....##\n.#...#.\n..#.#..\n...#...\n\nz=0\n...#...\n.......\n#......\n.......\n.....##\n.##.#..\n...#...\n\nz=1\n..#....\n...#...\n#......\n.....##\n.#...#.\n..#.#..\n...#...\n\nz=2\n.......\n.......\n..##...\n..###..\n.......\n.......\n.......\nAfter the full six-cycle boot process completes, 112 cubes are left in the active state.\n\nStarting with your given initial configuration, simulate six cycles. How many cubes are left in the active state after the sixth cycle?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 271.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nFor some reason, your simulated results don't match what the experimental energy source engineers expected. Apparently, the pocket dimension actually has four spatial dimensions, not three.\n\nThe pocket dimension contains an infinite 4-dimensional grid. At every integer 4-dimensional coordinate (x,y,z,w), there exists a single cube (really, a hypercube) which is still either active or inactive.\n\nEach cube only ever considers its neighbors: any of the 80 other cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most 1. For example, given the cube at x=1,y=2,z=3,w=4, its neighbors include the cube at x=2,y=2,z=3,w=3, the cube at x=0,y=2,z=3,w=4, and so on.\n\nThe initial state of the pocket dimension still consists of a small flat region of cubes. Furthermore, the same rules for cycle updating still apply: during each cycle, consider the number of active neighbors of each cube.\n\nFor example, consider the same initial state as in the example above. Even though the pocket dimension is 4-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1x1 region of the 4-dimensional space.)\n\nSimulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each given z and w coordinate:\n\nBefore any cycles:\n\nz=0, w=0\n.#.\n..#\n###\n\n\nAfter 1 cycle:\n\nz=-1, w=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0, w=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=1, w=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=-1, w=0\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0, w=0\n#.#\n.##\n.#.\n\nz=1, w=0\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=-1, w=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0, w=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=1, w=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\n\nAfter 2 cycles:\n\nz=-2, w=-2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1, w=-2\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=-2\n###..\n##.##\n#...#\n.#..#\n.###.\n\nz=1, w=-2\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=-2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-2, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=1, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-2, w=0\n###..\n##.##\n#...#\n.#..#\n.###.\n\nz=-1, w=0\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=0\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=1, w=0\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=0\n###..\n##.##\n#...#\n.#..#\n.###.\n\nz=-2, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=1, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-2, w=2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1, w=2\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=2\n###..\n##.##\n#...#\n.#..#\n.###.\n\nz=1, w=2\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\nAfter the full six-cycle boot process completes, 848 cubes are left in the active state.\n\nStarting with your given initial configuration, simulate six cycles in a 4-dimensional space.

The code should be enclosed using \"<execute_ipython>\" tag, for example:\n<execute_ipython>\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n</execute_ipython>\nThe assistant can execute bash commands on behalf of the user by wrapping them with <execute_bash> and </execute_bash>.\nFor example, you can list the files in the current directory by <execute_bash> ls </execute_bash>.\n\nApart from the standard Python library, the assistant can also use the following functions (already imported) in <execute_ipython> environment:\nopen_file(path: str, line_number: Optional[int] = None) -> None:\n    Opens the file at the given path in the editor. If line_number is provided, the window will be moved to include that line.\n    Args:\n    path: str: The path to the file to open.\n    line_number: Optional[int]: The line number to move to.\n\ngoto_line(line_number: int) -> None:\n    Moves the window to show the specified line number.\n    Args:\n    line_number: int: The line number to move to.\n\nscroll_down() -> None:\n    Moves the window down by 100 lines.\n    Args:\n    None\n\nscroll_up() -> None:\n    Moves the window up by 100 lines.\n    Args:\n    None\n\ncreate_file(filename: str) -> None:\n    Creates and opens a new file with the given name.\n    Args:\n    filename: str: The name of the file to create.\n\nappend_file(file_name: str, content: str) -> None:\n    Append content to the given file.\n    It appends text `content` to the end of the specified file.\n    Args:\n    file_name: str: The name of the file to append to.\n    content: str: The content to append to the file.\n\nedit_file(file_name: str, start: int, end: int, content: str) -> None:\n    Edit a file.\n    Replaces in given file `file_name` the lines `start` through `end` (inclusive) with the given text `content`.\n    Args:\n    file_name: str: The name of the file to edit.\n    start: int: The start line number. Must satisfy start >= 1.\n    end: int: The end line number. Must satisfy start <= end <= number of lines in the file.\n    content: str: The content to replace the lines with.\n\nsearch_dir(search_term: str, dir_path: str = './') -> None:\n    Searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory.\n    Args:\n    search_term: str: The term to search for.\n    dir_path: Optional[str]: The path to the directory to search.\n\nsearch_file(search_term: str, file_path: Optional[str] = None) -> None:\n    Searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file.\n    Args:\n    search_term: str: The term to search for.\n    file_path: Optional[str]: The path to the file to search.\n\nfind_file(file_name: str, dir_path: str = './') -> None:\n    Finds all files with the given name in the specified directory.\n    Args:\n    file_name: str: The name of the file to find.\n    dir_path: Optional[str]: The path to the directory to search.\n\nparse_pdf(file_path: str) -> None:\n    Parses the content of a PDF file and prints it.\n    Args:\n    file_path: str: The path to the file to open.\n\nparse_docx(file_path: str) -> None:\n    Parses the content of a DOCX file and prints it.\n    Args:\n    file_path: str: The path to the file to open.\n\nparse_latex(file_path: str) -> None:\n    Parses the content of a LaTex file and prints it.\n    Args:\n    file_path: str: The path to the file to open.\n\nparse_pptx(file_path: str) -> None:\n    Parses the content of a pptx file and prints it.\n    Args:\n    file_path: str: The path to the file to open.\n\nPlease note that THE `edit_file` FUNCTION REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If the assistant would like to add the line '        print(x)', it must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nThe assistant's response should be concise.\nThe assistant should include ONLY ONE <execute_ipython> or <execute_bash> in every one of the responses, unless the assistant is finished with the task or needs more input or action from the user in order to proceed.\nIMPORTANT: Whenever possible, execute the code for the user using <execute_ipython> or <execute_bash> instead of providing it.\n\n----------\n\nHere is an example of how you can interact with the environment for task solving:\n\n--- START OF EXAMPLE ---\n\nUSER: Please create a Python script that prints all even numbers from 1 to 10.\n\nASSISTANT: Let's start by creating a new file named `print_even_numbers.py`.\n<execute_ipython>\ncreate_file('print_even_numbers.py')\n</execute_ipython>\n\nUSER:\nOBSERVATION:\n[File: print_even_numbers.py (0 lines total)]\n[File print_even_numbers.py created.]\n\nASSISTANT: Now, let's add the code to print all even numbers from 1 to 10.\n<execute_ipython>\nCODE = \"\"\"for i in range(1, 11):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i)\n\"\"\"\nedit_file('print_even_numbers.py', start=1, end=1, content=CODE)\n</execute_ipython>\n\nUSER:\nOBSERVATION:\n[File: print_even_numbers.py (4 lines total)]\n1|for i in range(1, 11):\n2|    if i % 2 == 0:\n3|        print(i)\n[File updated. Please review the changes and make sure they are correct (correct indentation, no duplicate lines, etc). Edit the file again if necessary.]\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLE ---\n\n\n\nChallenge for Advent of Code:\n--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---\nA new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.\n\nTo ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.\n\nFor example:\n\naa bb cc dd ee is valid.\naa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.\naa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.\nThe system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 451.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nFor added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.\n\nFor example:\n\nabcde fghij is a valid passphrase.\nabcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.\na ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.\niiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.\noiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.\nUnder this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid?\n\nPlease write the solution in python. Save the solution in a file named solution.py. Ensure that your solution reads input from a file named input.txt in the same directory and prints the output to stdout.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nCreating the python file `solution.py`:\n<execute_ipython>\ncreate_file('solution.py')\n</execute_ipython>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nOBSERVATION:\n[File: /workspace/solution.py (1 lines total)]\n1|\n[File solution.py created.]\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nWriting the python code to `solution.py`:\n<execute_ipython>\nEDITED_CODE=\"\"\"with open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    passphrases = [line.strip().split() for line in file.readlines()]\n\n# Part One\nvalid_passphrases = 0\nfor passphrase in passphrases:\n    if len(passphrase) == len(set(passphrase)):\n        valid_passphrases += 1\n\nprint(valid_passphrases)\n\n# Part Two\ndef is_valid_passphrase(passphrase):\n    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in passphrase]\n    return len(sorted_words) == len(set(sorted_words))\n\nvalid_passphrases = 0\nfor passphrase in passphrases:\n    if is_valid_passphrase(passphrase):\n        valid_passphrases += 1\n\nprint(valid_passphrases)\"\"\"\nedit_file('solution.py', start=1, end=1, content=EDITED_CODE)\n</execute_ipython>\n"}]}
